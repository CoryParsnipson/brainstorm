Fuck work; let's skate lololoollololol420errydaaayyyy

Setup
-----

1. Make sure django-rest-framework (pip install djangorestframework) is installed as a python sitepackage (Python 2 supported)

2. To view the api, "git clone git@github.com:marcgibbons/django-rest-swagger ." to BASE_DIR/vendor/django-rest-swagger and then do "pip install django-rest-swagger"

3. Prepare a keyring.txt file (default location is in BASE_DIR, but you can edit filename and location in slackerparadise/settings.py). The format for each token is <name of key>:<key string value>. All lines that do not adhere to this format are considered comments.
