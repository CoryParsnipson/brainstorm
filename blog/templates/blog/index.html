<h3>the dolphins aren't all that</h3>
<p>I saw a nature special last night on Discovery or something about dolphins and how incredibly smart and whatever, y'know, they are, and I, to be honest I was drinking a little but still I was like, "whatever" I learned a little bit about dolphins in my Emerging Sciences class. I can tell you guys that dolphins are intelligent, but not as intelligent as you'd think an intelligent dolphin would be, kinda.</p>
<p>We (the U.S.) sort of discovered it by accident. I dunno if this is true, but I heard this guy went to this camera shop in Florida and was all, "I need all the 35mm rolls you got!" And the cashier is like, "Why, what's the deal" and the guy's like, "Well, there's these three dolphins under the pier over there talking about the ocean to this little kid, I gotta get this on film!" So the cashier, who happens to be in Mensa, goes down there, and sure enough, there's these three dolphin heads sticking out of the water yakkin' away about how big the ocean is to this teenager kid who's kind of looking around all dazed, like "what the fuck is this all about". So the Mensa op/cashier talks to the dolphins a little too and then phones it in to the command center, and it all kind of took off from there.</p>
<p>I guess it was pretty wild for a little bit then, because the Russians found out and were all tryin' to get in on it, and it was pretty tense, but then the dolphins were like, we'll talk to whichever country can beat our best, like, dolphin in chess, and we brought in Fischer, and that was pretty much that. So you can thank him that all the dolphins aren't Russian right now.</p>
<p>It all turned out to be a lot of hype, kinda. They're smart, but kinda distant. I hear they never shut up about the ocean and how, like, old it is. Which is neat at first, but apparently a lot of translators quit or transfer because they can't deal with it, like "OK I get it, they're fuckin' old, OK? Yeah, the oceans are huge, gotcha. Yeah, OK. Jesus Christ!", y'know?</p>
<p>They really like listening to the radio (the dolphins, not the translators!). I don't get that at all. And they don't have favorite stations, they're big-time channel surfers. It's like, to them, just the fact that you can change channels is cooler than the actual channels. I dunno, what is that all about?</p>
<p>I remember seeing this film on the progress they're making at the Belmont Institute, that secret whale lab thing in the, uh, the Caspian Sea, and there's this scientist who's clearly, like, pissing his pants, he's so happy to be on TV interviewing this dolphin, and there's a radio playing in the background, and it's hilarious because it's obvious in the whole thing that the dolphin's waaaaay more interested in the radio in the background than he is in talking with this scientist guy. It's like they're as bored with our math and cultural stuff as we are bored with the fucking radio and how big the ocean is. I mean, if they're that into the radio, how smart can they be anyway, is what I think about it.</p>
<p>But on the Emerging Science final exam, they ask you about it, and I was all, "It's pioneering research that is essential to the continued prosperity of Mother Earth, blah blah blah," and I got like 9 out of 10 on that question. Because even though, like, everybody I know thinks the whole thing is a waste of time, you're supposed to think it's pioneering and shit, y'know?</p>

<h3>Training days, part one</h3>
<p>I should probably talk about the training a little bit. I've been on the team for like four years now, I think, probably four. It's actually like six, but I took like a sabbatical in the middle to get some personal shit taken care of, and when I came back, they were like, "you've been gone more than six months, we have to treat you like a new employee", so I had to go through all the training again. It was pretty stupid, because I was like "I shouldn't have to go through all that again, I remember it all, I shouldn't have to do all the training again", and the chick on the phone's like, "yeah, I agree, it's stupid" but then she's like, "but you still have to do it". I'm like, if she agrees with me that it's stupid, why do I have to go do it again? We both agree it's stupid so what's the problem? But I guess she's probably just doing her job. So I had to do it all over again.</p>
<p>It wasn't as much fun the second time, because I knew what it was like, but it was still cool because the new guys I was with didn't know what to expect. So I was kinda messin' with them a little, about how I was an ex-Marine and Mensa training made boot camp look like kindergarten and shit. I had them pretty scared, which was cool. But then you get there to the compound and you find out that it's kind of like college. There's a lot of story problems. They say you need to be good at story problems because it prepares you for dealin' with real-life situations out in the field. That's the stupidest thing I ever heard. When I've got a gas leak out on the Siberian pipeline and I'm tryin' to figure out which valves to open in what order to seal the pipe, I'm not thinkin' about it like a story problem, you know? I'm just fuckin' with the valves tryin' to get it right without blowin' everything up, you know! So I think that's kinda stupid.</p>
<p>There's some cool classes too. They push a car over a cliff and you gotta get out and parachute down safely, but it's not a real cliff, it's this computer thing, but it's still scary even though you know when you're doin' it that it's not real. Why would they do all that training and then push you over a cliff? It's like, you know when you get in the car, "this is fake, I'm not really going over a cliff". But it's still neat.</p>
<p>They put you in this shark tank with a blindfold, and you gotta defuse this bomb, and it's pretty freaky. You're down there freakin' out and the sharks are bumping into you, and it's pretty crazy. I mean, there was a point there when I was like, what am I doing here, I must be crazy. But then when you're done, they take you out and let you watch the other trainees, and you see the tank and it's just full of these big catfish. I mean, they're pretty big, but they don't bite or nothin'. And you see these blindfolded guys thrashing around all crazy as these big catfish are bumping around. I saw this one guy punch a catfish right in the nose, killed the fucking fish right there. They pulled him right out of the tank and gave him demerits for killing the shark, which I thought was stupid. It's not even a shark, and if it was, he should get points for killing it! But I guess what they're sayin' is, you couldn't punch a shark and live, so why should we reward you for it. I can understand that, kinda. Part of being in this job is understanding where other people are coming from, know what I mean?</p>
