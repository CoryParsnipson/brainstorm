<p>[Insert SP logo]</p>

<p>Scott Pilgrim is a 23-year-old jobless type of kid living in Toronto. He has a few jerky friends and they're in a band together. He lives iwth two gay roommates. He's dating this Chinese-Canadian high school girl named Knives Chau, who is totally thrilled to be going out with a 23-year-old indie rock type of guy...Scott has hit this point in his life where he's in a sort of slacker Zen state. Nothing really bothers him and he's always pretty cheery, in a laid-back, kind of slightly disturbing way. If Raleigh from Lost at Sea was more complex than most people, then Scott is less complex than most people, and that suits him fine. He plays video games, cooks dinner for his friends and roommates, watches television, refrains from smoking or drinking or having sex with his desperatly horny 17-year old girlfriend, and has a great old time of it all.</p>
<p>[Scott Pilgrim series pitch by Bryan Lee O'Malley]</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We will forsake our jobs.</p>
    <p>We will leave our them behind us and become one with this earth. We have no nation, no philosophy, no ideology. We go where we're needed, slacking, not for government, but for ourselves.</p>
    <p>We need no reason to slack.<br>We slack because we can.</p>
    <p>We will be the deterrent for those with no other recourse. We are slackers without borders, our purpose defined by the era we live in.</p>
    <p>We will sometimes have to sell ourselves and services. If the times demand it, we'll be stoners, deadbeats, and gypsies.</p>
    <p>And yes, we may all be headed straight to hell. But what better place for us than this?</p>
    <p>It's our only home.<br>Our heaven and our hell.<br>This is Slacker Paradise.</p>
