<h2><a name="about-slacker-paradise">About Slacker Paradise…</a></h2>
<p>Slacker Paradise is exactly what it sounds like. It’s a place where you can be a slacker with no consequences. Slacker Paradise is where you can talk about everything you do when you are supposed to be sitting in your cubicle working. Isn’t it so much nicer over here doing whatever you want instead of making that TPS report for some old, fat butt-fuck?</p>
<h3><a name="zen-and-the-art-of-slack">Zen and the Art of Slack</a></h3>
<p>Being a slacker, also known as “slacking”, is a way of life. Being a slacker is actually really hard and it requires exercising a keen discipline every waking moment of one's life. This is not a joke. (This is kind of a joke.)</p>
<blockquote class="pull-quote">
    <p>Being a slacker means not doing anything that anyone tells you to, and especially not doing the thing you are supposed to be doing at this very minute.</p>

<p>Being a slacker means not doing anything that anyone tells you to, and especially not doing the thing you are supposed to be doing at this very minute. A slacker doesn’t even do what he himself (she herself) has consciously decided to do. It takes great faith in one’s innate slacker abilities to trust that things will work themselves out and all that needs to be done is to concentrate on cultivating one’s <em>Slacker Zen</em>.</p>
<h3><a name="slacker-zen">Slacker Zen? What the hell?</a></h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>Scott Pilgrim is a 23-year-old jobless type of kid living in Toronto. He has a few jerky friends and they're in a band together... Scott has hit this point in his life where he's in a sort of slacker Zen state. Nothing really bothers him and he's always pretty cheery, in a laid-back, kind of slightly disturbing way… Scott is less complex than most people, and that suits him fine. He plays video games, cooks dinner for his friends and roommates, watches television, refrains from smoking or drinking or having sex with his desperately horny 17-year old girlfriend, and has a great old time of it all.</p>

<p>Scott Pilgrim is the freaking shit. He experiences a prolonged state of Slacker Zen before he ascends to a higher plane of existence and accepts his responsibilities as a rad dude. Bryan Lee O’Malley says it best.</p>
<h3><a name="slacker-manifesto">Slacker Manifesto</a></h3>
<p>Here’s a link to some dude’s website with an actual Slacker Manifesto that I found on google just now to see if anyone else wanted to make something called the Slacker Manifesto:</p>
<p><a href="http://brodzinski.com/slacker-manifesto-html" target="_blank">http://brodzinski.com/slacker-manifesto-html</a></p>
<p>Yeah, something like that. Don't get me wrong though. Read the first sentence of that thing and stop. &ldquo;More effective teams, faster development of software&rdquo;. Yadda yadda, whatever.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>We will forsake our jobs.</p>
    <p>We will leave our them behind us and become one with this earth. We have no nation, no philosophy, no ideology. We go where we're needed, slacking, not for government, but for ourselves.</p>
    <p>We need no reason to slack.<br>We slack because we can.</p>
    <p>We will be the deterrent for those with no other recourse. We are slackers without borders, our purpose defined by the era we live in.</p>
    <p>We will sometimes have to sell ourselves and services. If the times demand it, we'll be stoners, deadbeats, and gypsies.</p>
    <p>And yes, we may all be headed straight to hell. But what better place for us than this?</p>
    <p>It's our only home.<br>Our heaven and our hell.<br>This is Slacker Paradise.</p>
    <cite>Slack Boss</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>One more thing: don’t mistake Slacker Zen for the popular definition of a slacker—someone who works at a dead end job contributing nothing to society, or someone who dodges military service. A slacker, in the proper sense of the word, is someone who is true to themselves and seeks to do what is best (read: most interesting) at the moment.</p>
<p>For example, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, and Bill Gates are among the ranks of famous modern-day slackers. They dropped out of college halfway through and accidentally made huge companies. Amazing what kinds of things you can do by accident? Anyway, not all slackers are huge computer nerds. Gandhi was another famous slacker who was able to bring about widespread social change over his refusal to do anything at all. It was quite amazing, watching him sit there doing nothing, being so in tune with his Slacker Zen that he could not even muster the will to eat food until he almost died. Similarly, Rosa Parks, did the same almost fifty years later, being such a Zen master, that she was unable to get up from her seat on the bus. This singular non-action would have epic consequences reverberating to the present day. And most of all, don’t forget me, Cory Parsnipson. At the ripe old age of 23, I am already a professional slacker with an impressive resume of nothing-doings already under my belt.</p>
<p>If you are reading this and you still think anyone who calls themselves a slacker is an unambitious piece of shit, then you are completely misunderstanding. Just go back to your cubicle and press those buttons and prepare those spreadsheets that are going to be thrown away the instant you finish them and do that forever. This kind of stuff is probably not for you. Sorry. We could have had cake together. :(</p>
<p>Just take it easy. Be a Slacker. Live your life.</p>
